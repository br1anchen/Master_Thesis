\noindent \gls{webrtc} is quite popular topic in the web development filed since the massive usage and development of \gls{html5} web applications on the internet. The initial purpose of this web \gls{api} is to provide the browser client the ability to create real-time conversation between each other. After many \gls{webrtc} based application came out in the market, it is quite normal to think about how to integrate these kinds of web applications with the current legacy telephony network as the next big step for this technology. The requirement of this function is not only from the traditional telephony operator but also the normal end-users.

\par As network operators aspect, \gls{webrtc} provides many opportunities to the future telecommunication business module. For mobile phone customers, operator can offer \gls{webrtc} service with session-based charging to the existing service plans. Messaging \gls{api}s can augment \gls{webrtc} web application with \gls{rcs} and other messaging services which developers have already implemented. Furthermore, since \gls{webrtc} is a web based \gls{api}, then the implementation of \gls{qos} for \gls{webrtc} can provide assurance to users and prioritize services (enterprise, emergency, law enforcement, eHealth) that a WebRTC service will work as well as they need it to. \gls{webrtc} almost provides network operator a complete new business market with a huge amount of new end-users.

\par As an end-user aspect, \gls{webrtc} provides a much simpler way to have real-time conversation with another end-user. It is based on browser and internet which almost personal or enterprise computer already have, without any installation and plugins, end-user can have exactly the same service which previous stand-alone desktop client provides. By the prototype system of this thesis will cover, the end-user can even have the real-time rich communication service with multiple kinds of end-users.

\par The goal of this thesis and prototype system is to make an unified communication solution for \gls{ip} network and traditional telephony network by using\gls{webrtc}.
