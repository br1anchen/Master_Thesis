\noindent \gls{webrtc} offers application developers the ability to write rich, real-time multimedia application (e.g. video chat) on the web, without requiring any plugins, downloads or installations. \gls{webrtc} is also currently the only existing soon-to-be standardized technology on the market to create horizontal cross-platform communication services, encompassing smartphones, tablets, PCs, laptops and TVs, which adds value for both consumers and enterprises. \gls{webrtc} gives operators the opportunity to offer telephony services to more devices, such as PCs, tablets and TVs.
This thesis considers how \gls{webrtc} can enhance the existing echo-systems for telephony and messaging services by providing the end-user rich application client.
\par It will also covers research about different solutions to implement \gls{webrtc} to cooperate with existing telephony services like hosted virtual \gls{pbx} services.
\par A prototype of \gls{webrtc} deployment based on different rich communication scenarios will be implemented along with this thesis. Some corresponding test and evaluation will be fulfilled in this prototype.
\par Research about advanced \gls{webrtc} usability in telephony and messaging services will be covered in this thesis by the feedback of the \gls{webrtc} prototype
